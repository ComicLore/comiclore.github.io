<p>Manga is an umbrella term for a wide variety of comic books and graphic novels originally produced and published in Japan. Unlike American comic books, which are usually printed in full color, Japanese manga are almost always published in black and white. Full-color prints are often only used for special releases.</br>The result is much more dynamic and varied expression of emotion, drama and action compared to written novel or american style of comic which is more like story book (you need to stop, look at pictures and spend time reading text).

<p>There's no denying that Marvel and DC have created some of the most memorable universes of all time, but there are some incredible worlds to discover if you look outside of the mega-brands. Without these upstart comic creators, we wouldn't have Hellboy, Witchblade, or Shazam!, and there are plenty of other fascinating characters to discover. If you're ready to expand your comic book horizons, here are the ten greatest Non-DC or Marvel superhero universes you need to check out right now.
